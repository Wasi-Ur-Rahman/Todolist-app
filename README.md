This is a simple todolist app created by me.

I used the following technologies: Express.js, node.js, html, css, EJS, lodash, MongoDB


How to install it?

1. first of all download the project in your directory.
2. go to that particular directory and open your code editor (such as VSCode).
3. after openning the vscode, go to the terminal and run the following command:
              npm install
Make sure that you have already installed node.js on your system.
4. after installing the packages, go to the terminal and run the following command:
            nodemon app.js
5. go to the web browser and go to the following address:
        localhost:3000
6. and boom the app is installed.
